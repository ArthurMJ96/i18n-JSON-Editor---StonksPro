# i18n-JSON-Editor---StonksPro
Simple Editor to modify multiple i18n-locales .json files at once.  
Made in 2 days, because I couldn't find the right i18n editor for me.  
Uses express server to serve & save .json files because I intended to run it on a local server and use via web app.  
Since some people wanted it, I just wrapped it in electron.  

## Simple UI

Works only if those files have the same object structure.

## Create new locals, with same object structure. + Options
